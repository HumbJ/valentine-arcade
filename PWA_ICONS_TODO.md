# PWA Icons TODO

The PWA setup requires proper icon files. You need to create:

1. `public/icon-192.png` - 192x192px icon
2. `public/icon-512.png` - 512x512px icon

## Quick Icon Generation Options:

### Option 1: Use an online tool
- Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- Upload a simple image (like a heart emoji screenshot)
- Download the generated icons

### Option 2: Create manually
- Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma)
- Create 192x192 and 512x512 versions
- Save as PNG with transparent or solid background

### Option 3: Use emoji
- Take a screenshot of 💝 emoji at large size
- Resize to 192x192 and 512x512
- Save as PNG

## Temporary workaround:
For now, the app will work without icons but won't have a proper icon when installed on the home screen.
